description : |
    <p>microTrait maps a genome sequence into a trait space, including discrete and continuous traits, as well as simple and composite. Traits are inferred from genes and pathways representing energetic, resource acquisition, and stress tolerance mechanisms, while genome-wide signatures are used to infer composite, or life history, traits of microorganisms.</p>
